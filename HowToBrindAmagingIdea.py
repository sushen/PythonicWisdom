# Ita all about who consciously you think.
# In my opinions if you think  3 to 4 days of a idea you will bring a sophisticate idea to world.

# Lest Understand if you do a 8 hours job in a corporate house
# and you do 5 days in a week basic with lifetime.
# lets say you join this job in you 26 years age and
# you will retired in your 56 years old how many hours you expend in your work.
# Its you achievement of lifetime. it ant it?

# Lets bring the mathematics.

# Now People are saying its take 2 to 3 years to stabilise a business idea.
# You must understand what is Idea?
# Idea is some thing can solve problem.
# Idea comes your mind every time any time.
# Sometime you write it down and most of the time its go way and its naver come back.
# People hardly use there own Idea.
# Some People really do and they stack in there Own Idea and 2 to 3 years pass and they make there family happy.
# In my opinion you can hardly think 10 mints and extend your idea and within 3 years you loos full motivation.
# So What will be the Mathematics of that?

# So In my opinion with deep contemplating if you bring a problem its take not more than 2 days to solve.
# But I will want tell you some more. The Moon Science. Every mature woman will understand it more than man.
# Every Full Moon Our Body become full face just like the ocean.
# Our Hormonal condition is right to motivate our body.
# If you practices this before Full Moon Your Body will be Supportive.
# After Full Moon Its not Ideal Body Condition to Do Such Thing.
